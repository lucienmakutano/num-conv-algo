# Implementation of number conversion algorithm

This repo Implements two algorithms

1. convert a whole number to binary, hexadecimal and octal
2. convert floating numbers into their corresponding binary

### Both the algorithms don't cater for cases of negative numbers

## System requirements

- A C++ compiler
- VS Code (optional)
- C/C++ Microsoft extension (only if using vs code)

## Technologies

- C++
- vs Code

## How to use

To run the any of the algorithms,
you have to open it in VS Code then
press `ctl + shift + B` for windows users.

Or You can compiler it manually using any C++ compiler
then run the executable file `.exe`.
